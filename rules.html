							<h2>Rules for the Bidding Process</h2>
							<p>To bid on a project, you must purchase "tickets" which are at a fixed value.
							    For example, if the ticket is $500, then to bid $1000 you have to purchase two of them.
							    It is important to note that <b>all</b> bids submitted are processed, not only the winning bid.</p>
							<p>There are 26 project tiles, 4 trades tiles and 6 Chance tiles.</p>
							<p>The project tiles make up the usual property tiles of a Monopoly game and consist of 26 projects that PCL/ED are currently working on
								or have worked on in the past with many great partners. Show your company pride by snatching one of these tiles!
							</p>
							<p>The highest contributor by a participant on a project will have their company name
							    associated with that tile. The project tiles will be inserted onto the CHEO-opoly board based on the highest to lowest
							    final bids for each project. The highest bid being on Boardwalk Pl. moving counterclockwise and lowest bid being on 
							    Mediterranean Ave. If you are outbid, you can increase your total contribution in the name of a project by purchasing
							    more tickets, but you <b>must</b> use the same name and email when submitting.</p>
							<p>Trades can also bid on the trades tiles which will be named the respective utility serviced by 
							    each of the top four bidders.</p>
							<p>The names put on the Chance tiles will be drawn at the end. To increase your chances,
								you can purchase more of these less expensive tickets.</p>
							<p>The winner of the Prison tile bid will get to "send another rival company to jail". The start tile is also up for grabs as a larger tile to snatch.</p>
							<p>We will also be keeping track of the highest overall contributor to this event and they will also be honoured on one of the 4 corner tiles!</p>
							<p>Everyone who has donated in the name of a Project, Trades, Prison or Start tile will have their name included somewhere on the board, 
							   even if they are not the tile winner. Companies who bid on the Chance tile only and are not the tile winner will not be added to the board.</p>
